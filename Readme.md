  - Sellers can list items with a set price, creating an on-chain record of the sale offer.
- **Buy Item**:
  - Buyers can purchase listed items by transferring AptosCoin to the seller, completing the transaction securely on the blockchain.

## Future Scope

1. **Item Cataloging**:
   - Add functionality to catalog and track multiple items, including item descriptions and unique identifiers.
2. **Escrow Integration**:

   - Integrate escrow functionality to hold payments until both parties are satisfied with the transaction.

3. **Multi-Asset Support**:
   - Expand the marketplace to support multiple token types, allowing trades with various cryptocurrencies.

The **Simple Marketplace** smart contract provides a foundation for peer-to-peer buying and selling on the blockchain, ensuring transparent and secure transactions without intermediaries.
